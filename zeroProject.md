# ZeroProject:

----------

### Warning! Before proceeding, please acknowledge that ZeroProject's save browser does contain mild spoilers.

### Launch ZeroProject [here](https://incognistructura.github.io/ZeroProject/).

## About:

ZeroProject is currently in the open-beta version _0.9b_, immediately prior to the full release, which will occur on 31 May. In order to use it, simply press this [link](https://incognistructura.github.io/ZeroProject/). It is currently in open-beta, because among other things, full functionality has not yet been pushed to the website, and constant testing will be going on. ZeroProject will be fully released on 31 May, 2018 along with any other content neccessary. These features will include a save locator quiz, in order to better pinpoint your save, further title pictures, as well as revamped descriptions and a search engine.

**So, what is ZeroProject?**

> ##### ZeroProject, originally named arbitrarily is a Night In The Woods online save-directory project that was originally created to assist with players who had lost their save either due to a glitch in the game, or some other non-escapable problem. It was originally created by IncogniStructura on 1 May 2018, with the intention of solving this problem.

**Why was ZeroProject created?**

> ##### I also struggled with the same technical issues that still plague many players, and was forced to restart my save. Unfortunately, this meant playing through the entire game again on the _same_ timeline, and I didn't feel like this needed to exactly happen to anyone else. So, I compiled a folder of over 160+ save files in order to ensure that this couldn't happen again to me, or to anyone else for that matter.

## How to Use:

ZeroProject is rather simple to use. Simply click the link provided at the top, or copy and paste this _(without the quotation marks_) into your browser's URL bar: "https://incognistructura.github.io/ZeroProject/". Once there, follow this step-by-step guide towards regaining your save.
	
1. Once the page has fully loaded, (as viewed by the loading indicator at the top left of your browser), press the "Launch" button right beneath ZeroProject. This will take you to ZeroProject's default save browser.
2. Using your mouse, pan to your given save, as you normally would do in Google Maps. Once at your given save, click on it in order to verify that it is indeed your save.
3. In the left hand side, you can see all sorts of details on this save. Each save comes complete with its own unique description in order to better orient the user. Read the description and see if it sounds like your save.
4. Once you have verified whether it is your save or not, scroll down in the bottom-left corner where there is a scrollbar. Scroll all the way down, and hit the download button. This will download a .zip file containing the neccessary items.
5. Once downloaded, on the lower left, you'll see a folder with a zipper as a icon. Click on it, then double-click to open the folder within the zip file. Now, drag and select all files inside of the folder. Now listen carefully.
	1. If you are on **Windows**, press Ctrl + C. Then go to "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\LocalLow\InfiniteFall\". Then press Ctrl + V. Load up Night In The Woods as you would normally, and hop right in where you left off!
	2. If you are on **MacOS**, press ⌘ + C. Then go to "~/Library/Application Support/unity.Infinite Fall.Night in the Woods/". Then press ⌘ + V. Load up Night In The Woods as you would normally, and hop right in where you left off!
